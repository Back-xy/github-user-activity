# GitHub Activity CLI

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application from https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity for fetching and displaying the recent activity of a GitHub user. By providing a GitHub username, you can retrieve the latest events associated with that user, such as commits, issues, stars, forks, and more. This project helps in practicing API interaction, JSON data handling, and building a CLI application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
